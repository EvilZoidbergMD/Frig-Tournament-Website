            <h1>T1 Frigate Tournament is here!</h2>

            <p>At 5:00pm (Central, also tentative) this Friday, our corp will gather to blow shit up. Or get blown up. Something like that. In a world where T1 frigates are all you can fly, and T2 fittings are the limit, one man (or woman) will be crowned champion.<p>

            <ul>
                <h2>The Rules:</h2>
                <li>Tech 1 Frigates only</li>
                <li>Tech 2 fittings maximum (no faction/complex/officer/etc)</li>
                <li>The tournament will consist of a series of 1v1 fights to the death (jk no podding)</li>
                <li>Both parties will start at the same station in whatever system we end up doing this in (probably Amarr or Jita)</li>
                <li>Both parties warp at whatever range they choose to one of the referees</li>
                <li>As soon as you exit warp, the fight starts</li>
                <li>If you get more than 75km away from the referee, you will be disqualified</li>
                <li>If you are running away with a clear intent of not fighting, everyone will blap you</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There will be a 5 million isk entrance fee (if this is actually a problem, ask one of the vets in game and I'm sure they'll pay for you). The winner will get 50% of the prize pool, the runner up will get 30% and the third place finisher will get 20%.</p>
            <p>PS: For a small fee of 20 million isk, I, Better Kyle, will help you to create and practice your fit! (capitalism intensifies)</p>
